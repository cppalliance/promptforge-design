# Generic Realtime STT installed-package acceptance

## Status

Verification round 3 passed the complete automated release suite, rebuilt and silently installed a fresh unsigned package, and passed the installed local-sidecar recovery scenario. Workshop and Gateway stayed live beyond 60 seconds, Workshop survived forced Gateway termination, and a replacement was accepted by changed PID and boot identity while the configured bearer remained stable. The installed replacement passed process-image, health, accepted-bearer, rejected-bearer, Workshop relay, config-proxy, and Realtime checks. Deterministic tests passed for atomic publication to heartbeat, catalog, chat, progress, config proxy, and Realtime, fixed explicit-LAN behavior, same-port and same-key replacement, configured-key edits, and exactly one boundary space between two standalone no-leading dictation takes.

- Automated release gate: passed
- Installed-process gate: passed
- Post-relaunch recovery gate: passed
- Physical microphone and device-error checks: passed by final operator acceptance
- Installed application: `C:\Users\Vinnie\AppData\Local\PromptForge\promptforge-workshop.exe`
- Installed Workshop left open: PID 87536
- Installed Gateway left open: PID 96452 on port 51984
- Signing: not tested; release signing remains release-CI-only
- Commit created: no

## 2026-09-08 installed rolling-dictation acceptance

- Package: fresh unsigned NSIS installer containing bounded estimated overlap reconciliation and live pending-prefix continuity
- Installed paths: `C:\Users\Vinnie\AppData\Local\PromptForge\promptforge-workshop.exe` and sibling `promptforge-gateway.exe`
- Physical microphone: passed
- Live trailing hypothesis replacement: passed
- Operator verdict: `The microphone worked really well.`
- Installer finish-page contrast: passed; the operator confirmed the contrast problem was solved
- Installer component wording: changed afterward to `PromptForge Workshop`, `PromptForge Gateway`, and `Speech to Text (Transcription)` and pending package confirmation
- Remote release and path-gated installer smoke checks: passed
- Remaining remote full-CI and native-Whisper waits: explicitly waived by the operator after local verification and physical microphone acceptance
- Signing: not tested; release signing remains release-CI-only

## Step 32 deterministic arbitrary-duration acceptance

### Acceptance boundary

- Date: 2026-09-08
- Scope: deterministic production-session, mounted Gateway, Workshop relay, and Workshop UI verification
- Physical microphone acceptance: not performed and not claimed
- Commit created: no

### One-hour one-take proof

`one_take_runs_for_an_hour_with_bounded_absolute_ownership` drives the production Realtime `Session`, interim scheduler, final pipeline, rolling PCM compaction, overlap reconciliation, mailbox, commit, and completion with 360 ten-second strides. It uses six rotated append sizes of 1, 23,999, 72,000, 17, 47,983, and 96,000 input samples, no sleep, and no hour-sized audio allocation. Every received 16 kHz window contains absolute second markers derived from the actual 24 kHz PCM. The decoder derives coverage and transcript ranges from those markers and rejects wrong, stale, duplicated, reordered, or incorrectly compacted samples.

- Logical ownership: one provisional item ID remains unchanged for all 360 strides; one `UncommittedInput` and `Take` are promoted by one commit
- Completion: one completed result for that same item and no second terminal
- Usage: exactly 86,400,000 input samples at 24 kHz and exactly `3,600.0` completion seconds
- Absolute coverage: finalized coverage plus the sole unresolved forced range remains contiguous from sample zero through 57,600,000 at 16 kHz, then completion resolves the full range
- Final windows: 360 accurate decodes; the first owns 10 seconds and every later window owns at most 18 seconds through the fixed 8-second overlap
- Retained ownership: allocated resident, queued, and actively decoding PCM remains under the exact 480,000-sample, 30-second budget
- Bounded state: the hour proof retains at most one queued final, one pending final outcome, and two accepted hypotheses at each settled stride; the independent blocked-worker scenario exercises two queued finals and the exact retained-budget refusal
- Hypotheses: 360 production interim revisions remain complete replacement snapshots with stable absolute audio spans while finalized audio compacts
- Final transcript: the authoritative result contains each of the 3,600 timeline tokens exactly once
- Mounted Gateway: the production WebSocket route receives the same 360 marked strides, retains one item ID, accepts one commit, emits one completion, and reports exactly 3,600 seconds
- Natural pauses: 8,209 decoded-speech and silence cycles settle online with zero retained outcome history, while a partial short-final skip retains at most one range until it consumes its accepted hypothesis
- Transient PCM: source resampler capacity is charged before destination growth or copying; the exact combined source, destination, and growth peak succeeds and one sample less of budget fails before mutation

The focused boundary suite also covers stop before, exactly on, and after a forced cut; a natural boundary following a forced cut; repeated phrases; punctuation and case normalization; fail-closed missing alignment; clear; session and worker cancellation; and slower-than-capture overload. These are deterministic protocol and ownership claims, not claims about physical microphone capture duration.

### Throughput overload behavior

The mounted Gateway test blocks an accurate decoder, admits the next ten-second stride while the first decode remains owned, then rejects the following transient source-plus-destination allocation with decoded code `too_much_unfinalized_audio` and commits the still-valid input through the same mounted socket. The Workshop relay passes 360 reused bounded chunks opaquely and preserves one item, one commit, and one 3,600-second completion. The pure `TakeRegistry` and production `setupStt` tests stream 360 bounded appends while retaining only the latest active append correlation; a stale retired correlation cannot mutate the take, and duplicate overload delivery causes one capture stop and one commit with no clear or rollback. Other decoded server errors continue through the existing rollback path.

### Step 32 automated results

- Gateway: full package tests passed, including 96 integration tests with 5 ignored native cases; the mounted hour and slower-than-capture Realtime tests passed
- Gateway STT: default and `test-fixtures` suites each passed 64 tests with 2 ignored native cases; the one-hour proof passed in 8.8 seconds
- Workshop relay: 10 passed
- Workshop UI: typecheck, production build, layer gate, 87-test suite, and dedicated leak check passed
- Gateway Config UI: typecheck, production build, layer gate, and 129-test suite passed
- Miri: engine filter passed 3 tests; Gateway STT filter passed 13 tests
- Architecture and API: architecture self-tests, exact feature API snapshot, source-module ceilings, integration test manifest, crate dependency graph, and Rust architecture harness passed
- Repository hygiene: `cargo fmt --all --check` and warnings-denied all-target all-feature workspace Clippy passed
- Guides: source generation passed twice and the second generation produced byte-identical outputs

- Release, staged, and installed Gateway SHA-256: `C60DFDEBC6E45EEE82AF6952FF81CF1B0A1F0B92ADC8EA1BFE68F82105E8C06B`
- Tauri CLI locked install gate: passed with version 2.11.4 already installed
- Fresh unsigned NSIS package build: passed
- Final installer SHA-256: `5ABFB2436BC18FCD8DD9EF0D0923F414AB47E0D20661978C11A8520305AA21ED`
- Silent install exit code: 0
- Installed Workshop SHA-256: `6A25AD42F771CE07C1BD7D70365C0436D5CF6CEC91E83D506D97B98C47548C4B`
- Installed Workshop identity: product `PromptForge`, version `0.2.0`, unsigned, expected installed path
- The installed and bundle-stage Workshop images had equal size and matching product identity but different PE hashes after NSIS extraction
- Protected release configuration cleanliness: passed
- Signing: not tested; release signing remains release-CI-only

The first round 3 package observation successfully built and installed the package, then stopped on a verifier-added Workshop byte-equality assertion. That assertion was not a release requirement and was invalid for the observed NSIS image transformation. The failure remains recorded. The corrected identity gate checks installed path, product name, product version, image size, and unsigned status, while the Gateway sidecar retains byte-for-byte release, staging, and installed equivalence. The corrected package and installation phase was then repeated from the release build and passed.

The initial Gateway was force-terminated at `2026-09-07T15:05:23.2482189Z` while Workshop PID 55388 remained running. Gateway logging and the live connection file showed an installed sibling replacement starting at `2026-09-07T15:05:26.7613168Z`, with PID 35008 and port 60892. The first observer timed out because it incorrectly required PID, port, and key all to change. Replacement requires a new PID or boot identity, while an OS-assigned port may be reused and an unchanged configuration preserves its long-term credential.

A second direct observation repeated the forced termination:

- Gateway before termination: PID 35008 on port 60892
- Forced termination: `2026-09-07T15:08:24.5934571Z`
- Workshop PID 55388 stayed running: yes
- Replacement Gateway started: `2026-09-07T15:08:27.1643234Z`
- Replacement observed after approximately 2.571 seconds
- Replacement Gateway PID: 59984
- Replacement Gateway port: 61013
- Replacement Gateway path: `C:\Users\Vinnie\AppData\Local\PromptForge\promptforge-gateway.exe`
- PID changed: yes
- Port changed: yes
- Bearer key remained present: yes
- Bearer key changed: no, as expected for the unchanged Gateway configuration
- Bearer key value: not recorded
- Actual installed health, model-catalog, chat, progress, config-proxy, and Realtime recovery probes after relaunch: not run because the observer applied the false changed-key precondition
- Release verdict: incomplete; the replacement process identity passed, but installed recovery and remaining physical acceptance still require observation

### Final handoff boundary

- Installed Workshop PID 55388 remained open at `2026-09-07T15:10Z`
- Installed Gateway PID 59984 remained open on port 61013 at `2026-09-07T15:10Z`
- No microphone, second-take, Clear, cancellation, permission-denial, unavailable-device, or model-turn scenario was physically performed in this verification round
- Signing was not tested; release signing remains release-CI-only

## Final topology and documentation evidence

This section records the Step 40 architecture result. It does not replace or extend the installed-microphone verdict above.

### Debt before and after

- Temporary workspace dependency exceptions: 1 before, 0 after
- Migration-target exceptions: 6 before, 0 after
- Forbidden `gateway-stt -> workshop-server` edges: 1 before, 0 after
- STT source modules above 500 physical lines: 3 before, 0 after
- Largest STT source module: 712 lines before, 481 after
- Effective public-root policy: allowances `9, 7, 2, 6` before; exact counts `6, 7, 2, 6` after
- STT production-library module cycles: 0 after
- Legacy `/stt`, `/stt/capability`, Workshop status/header, and Workshop STT dependency exceptions: 0 after

The engine's 667-line scripted fixture was split into a 362-line fixture and a 304-line test module without changing its 22 unit, 6 contract, 8 startup-cleanup, or documentation test results.

### Final gates

- `node --test tools/check-stt-architecture.test.mjs`: passed, 13 tests
- `node tools/check-stt-architecture.mjs`: passed; all four STT crates acyclic with exact public roots `6, 7, 2, 6`
- `cargo test -p gateway-stt --test it architecture`: passed, 15 tests
- `cargo fmt --all --check`: passed
- `cargo run -p build-user-guide`: passed; all nine generated artifacts had identical SHA-256 values on the clean second run
- `$env:RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN='stable'; cargo install mdbook --version 0.4.44 --locked`: passed
- `mdbook build guide`: passed

### Final documentation and rules audit

- Added the final architecture design covering ownership, exact dependencies, public counts, Realtime wire policy, bounds, profile replacement, Workshop relay behavior, CI gates, and debt results.
- Updated Gateway, config, Workshop server, and source-guide documentation to remove the retired custom routes and describe `/v1/realtime`.
- Regenerated every guide index and all four single-file exports through `build-user-guide`.
- Corrected the root build prerequisite because a Gateway-only build no longer includes Workshop UI tooling.
- Corrected Workshop's error rule because Workshop no longer provisions STT.
- Audited `gateway-stt`, `gateway-stt-engine`, `gateway-stt-backend-whisper`, `gateway`, and `shared-loopback` rules; their final constraints remain concrete and correct, so they were unchanged.

## Installed sibling verification

### Workshop

- Path: `C:\Users\Vinnie\AppData\Local\PromptForge\promptforge-workshop.exe`
- Size: 24,210,432 bytes

- Launched: `2026-09-07T04:30:08.4151156Z`
- Workshop process ID: 48564
- Gateway process ID: 59724
- Both process paths resolve under `C:\Users\Vinnie\AppData\Local\PromptForge`
- Both processes remained running at `2026-09-07T04:30:16.5398864Z`

## Operator observations - later build-tree launch

- Observed: approximately `2026-09-07T06:33Z` through `2026-09-07T06:36Z`
- Acceptance applicability: none; process inspection showed both Workshop and Gateway running from `C:\Users\Vinnie\cursor\promptforge\target\release`, not the installed `AppData\Local\PromptForge` paths
- Gateway readiness: serving at `06:33:11Z`, speech ready with GPU and profile switched by `06:33:13Z`, `claude-opus-4-6` advertised, chat endpoint ready
- Workshop model catalog: failed; the picker exposed no model even though Gateway advertised `claude-opus-4-6`
- Realtime connection: failed latency; microphone readiness took approximately 20 to 30 seconds
- Live hypotheses: failed; no text evolved while recording
- Completion: functional; correct text appeared only after stop
- Status lifecycle: failed; the progress bar remained visible after profile completion and the normal LEDs did not return
- Diagnosis: Workshop refreshed model state before Gateway profile publication and did not retry while health stayed reachable; precommit hypothesis IDs were not bound to the active take; the imported Gateway progress operation remained attached to the never-ending SSE stream after its root finished

## Prior failed observations - first installed attempt

### Dictation

- Observed: approximately `2026-09-07T03:55Z` through `2026-09-07T03:57Z`
- Result: partial success, latency failure
- Evidence: the installed Workshop first displayed `Dictation is connecting. Try again in a moment.`, then eventually inserted `Tell me a story, is it gonna work? I don't think it's gonna work.`
- Connection delay: 5 to 15 seconds
- Stop-to-final delay: 5 to 15 seconds
- Verdict: the installed speech path works functionally, but both observed delays exceed the two-second acceptance budget

### Model turn after dictation

- Observed: approximately `2026-09-07T03:57Z`
- Result: failed
- Evidence: the model picker still displayed `Select model`; submission persisted the user message and a tool result containing the dictated text, but no assistant message followed
- Session log: `dd27eef4544a74d2b12e9f1a25251000`
- Gateway state during diagnosis: running, profile `default`, `claude-opus-4-6` advertised, chat endpoint ready, speech ready with GPU, no active or pending command
- Network state during diagnosis: Workshop retained local Gateway connections, while Gateway held no outbound provider connection
- Verdict: no Anthropic request was reached; the local no-model binding error returned through Lua `pcall` without an operator-visible response

## Operator observation checklist retained for audit context

This checklist records the detail originally requested for the post-Step 37 build. Unchecked items were not individually recorded and are not retroactively claimed as measured. The post-Step 37 verdict below remains historical evidence and does not complete the later Step 42 repeat.

- [ ] Confirm both chat model menus, the inline dropdown and the top-level `Model` menu, show only chat-capable models and do not list speech-only models.
- [ ] Select `claude-opus-4-6`, submit typed input, and confirm the selected Claude model completes the turn with an assistant response.
- [ ] Confirm live speech revisions replace rather than duplicate provisional text, with exact spacing preserved.
- [ ] Confirm completion commits the final transcript exactly once.
- [ ] Start a second take and confirm it is independent of the first.
- [ ] Clear the transcript and confirm the visible and retained take state clears.
- [ ] Cancel an active take and confirm no later hypothesis or completion is applied.
- [ ] Deny microphone permission or select an unavailable device, confirm a recoverable error, restore access, and confirm a new take works.
- [ ] Measure connection delay from microphone activation to ready capture.
- [ ] Measure stop-to-final delay from stop action to committed final transcript.
- [ ] Record the installed Workshop path, sibling Gateway path, installer path, sizes, SHA-256 hashes, and UTC timestamps.

Automated preparation did not perform the checklist. The operator later observed the post-Step 37 installed build and accepted it as recorded below, without supplying measurements or item-by-item results beyond those stated.

## Operator acceptance - post-Step 37 installed build

- Observed: approximately `2026-09-07T12:15Z`
- Build under test: installed unsigned package built from `2d1ecca8`
- Short-utterance Stop regression: passed; repeated utterances with the last word spoken immediately before Stop retained the correct final word
- Live transcription: passed; operator reported the repaired behavior works correctly
- Overall operator verdict: `Works correctly. Accepted.`
- Signing: not tested; release signing remains a release-CI gate

## Operator observations - post-Step 36 installed attempt

- Observed: approximately `2026-09-07T10:59Z`
- Live hypotheses: substantially improved; the prior repeated-phrase accumulation was not observed
- Stop finalization: failed intermittently; a correct word appeared in the latest live hypothesis, then pressing Stop removed that word from the authoritative completion
- Verdict: cadence and whole-window rebasing improved the live path, but Step 37 remains failed because completion can discard recognized audio-backed tail text

## Operator observations - post-Steps 34 and 35 installed attempt

- Observed: approximately `2026-09-07T09:47Z`
- Chat model menus: passed; speech-only models no longer appeared
- Typed model turn: passed; selected chat model responded
- Live hypotheses: failed; provisional text still accumulated repeated phrases while recording instead of presenting one evolving replacement
- Completion: prior behavior indicates Stop replaces provisional text with the clean authoritative final, but the full completion checklist was not repeated in this observation
- Verdict: Step 34 repairs passed installed observation; Step 35 did not repair the real native interim sequence, so Step 36 remains failed

## Prior failed observations - pre-Steps 34 and 35 installed attempt

- Observed: approximately `2026-09-07T08:45Z`
- Model catalog: `claude-opus-4-6` was visible and selected
- Chat model menus: failed filtering; both the inline dropdown and top-level `Model` menu listed `whisper-base-en`, `whisper-small-en`, and `realtime-transcribe`, which are speech models and must not be selectable for chat
- Typed model turn: failed; submitting `test 1 2 3` persisted the user input and tool result, then displayed `Error: Model turn failed in agent 'chat'`
- Model-turn diagnosis: Workshop launched the built-in chat session before Gateway published its profile models, freezing an empty session model catalog; later catalog convergence updated the picker but not that running session, so binding failed locally before any Gateway completion request
- Live hypotheses: failed replacement behavior; revisions appeared while recording but accumulated repeatedly in the editor
- Completion: functional replacement; pressing Stop removed the duplicated provisional text and left the correct final transcript
- Verdict: Step 34 remains failed; model-session catalog convergence and live ProseMirror range replacement require repair before acceptance can be repeated

- Exact PowerShell 5.1 package command: `$env:RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN='stable'; cargo --% tauri build --bundles nsis --config {\"bundle\":{\"createUpdaterArtifacts\":false}}`
  - Result: passed, exit code 0, 107.781 seconds; release profile finished in 1 minute 11 seconds and produced one NSIS bundle
  - Override scope: `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts=false` was supplied only through the command line
  - Protected release configuration: `crates/workshop/tauri.conf.json` and `.github/workflows/release-workshop.yml` remained clean
- Fresh installer:

  - Native package equivalence: installed, staged, and release Gateway hashes match exactly

### Installed launch and operator boundary

- Installed Workshop launch: passed
- Handoff observed: `2026-09-07T14:00:32.5494104Z`
- Workshop process: PID 92768 at `C:\Users\Vinnie\AppData\Local\PromptForge\promptforge-workshop.exe`
- Gateway process: PID 65268 at `C:\Users\Vinnie\AppData\Local\PromptForge\promptforge-gateway.exe`
- Readiness observation: both installed processes remained running 20 seconds after launch
- Automated Step 42 gates: passed
- Physical observation completed: microphone recording and chat turns on the reopened installed Workshop
- Remaining physical scenarios:
  - Confirm a second take is independent
  - Confirm clear removes visible and retained take state
  - Confirm cancellation prevents later hypothesis or completion application
  - Confirm permission denial or unavailable-device failure is recoverable, then restore access and complete a new take
- Signing: not tested
- Handoff note: after the recorded readiness check the Workshop window closed while Gateway PID 65268 remained running. The installed Workshop was reopened as PID 73520 after the `2026-09-07T14:00:32.5494104Z` handoff and before the approximately `2026-09-07T14:03Z` observation. Its exact process start timestamp was not retained, and PID 73520 is no longer running.

### Final installed operator acceptance

- Observed: approximately `2026-09-07T14:03Z`
- Package under test: the fresh Step 42 unsigned installer recorded above
- Installed Workshop process: PID 73520
- Observed scope: microphone recording and chat turns
- Operator verdict for that scope: `works beautifully`
- Not independently observed: second-take independence, Clear, cancellation, and permission-denial or unavailable-device recovery
- Physical acceptance: incomplete pending those four scenarios
- Signing: not tested; release signing remains a release-CI gate
